# This is the Benchmarking harness. This script is the single entry point for
# performing any of the benchmarks provided here. In order to run the
# benchmarks, execute this script with the name of the benchmark to run.
#
# USAGE:
#
# $ ./benchmark [OPTIONS] -n <TEST-NAME>
#
#   Options:
#     -s		Skip downloading / updating the sources for each program
#     -b		Skip trying to rebuild each program
#     -n		The name of the test to execute
#
# The specification for each program used in the comparitive Benchmarks is
# defined in the `sources/' directory, with the filename: <program>.bench.sh.
# Each of these files should define the following:
#
#	- <PROGRAMNAME>_SOURCE=https://path/to/git/repo
#	- <PROGRAMNAME>_OPTIONS="--default-options --for-all-benchmarks"
#	- <PROGRAMNAME>_BIN="./relative/path/to/binary/from/source/dir"
#	- <PROGRAMNAME>_BUILD(): Function that defines how to build a fresh copy of
#	the source
#	- <PROGRAMNAME>_VERSION(): Function to retreive the version of the built
#	source
#
#	Do take a look at the files for Wget2 or Wget for an idea of how this is
#	done.
#
#
# Similar to the program specification, is the specification for the Benchmarks
# themselves. Each of the benchmarks is located in the 'benches/' directory.
# The benchmark specification should define the following:
#
#  - BENCHMARK_PROGRAMS as an array of programs to be used
#  - run_bench() function to execute the benchmark. It accepts 1 argument, the
#  program name.
#  - finish_bench() to finish the benchmark and cleanup. No arguments.
#
# The benchmark specification file may assume that all the variables defined in
# the program specification are available in its namespace during execution:
#
# - An empty associative array called "test_OPTIONS". Which can be filled up
# with comand line options specific to this benchmark
# - KERNEL: A variable which contains the information about the currently
# running kernel. (uname -srmo)
# - PROC: A variable with information about the processor
# - PING: A variable containing the ping latency to example.com
